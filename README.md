# Web App for Data Collection

This web application is built with Node.js, Express, Handlebars, and MongoDB. Its main purpose is to collect data from users, which is then stored in a MongoDB database. The data collected will be used in the future to train a neural network and to create a REST API that can respond to messages and queries based on the information stored in the database.

## Getting Started

To run this application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the server: `npm start`

The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

To use the application, open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000. You will be presented with a form where you can input data to be stored in the database. Once the data is submitted, it will be saved to the database and a confirmation message will be displayed.
